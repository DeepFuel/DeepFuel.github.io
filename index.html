      <h2>About DeepFuel-kit</h2>
      <p>
         <strong>DeepFuel-kit</strong> is an open-source Python library for AI-guided formulation of next-generation sustainable fuels.
      <p>
        Greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction is becoming imperative for energy utilisation based on fossil fuels. 
        Liquid fossil fuels (including petrol, diesel, kerosene etc.) account for more than 30% of the world’s 
        total energy supply and remains the single most important fuel source. 
        Due to their favourable properties such as high energy density and easy to store/transport, 
        liquid fuels will be continuously used. In heavy transport applications (such as aviation, road freight and shipping), 
        kerosene, diesel and heavy fuel oil (HFO) are dominantly used, which contribute to over 50% of 
        the GHG emissions from the transport sector. However, these applications are “difficult-to-decarbonise”, 
        because electrification and hydrogen are unlikely to replace fuels in the near future. 
        Nevertheless, low-carbon alternative fuels have to be adopted to gradually replace fossil fuels.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Reducing the negative environmental impacts of fossil fuel utilisation requires a shift 
        towards more sustainable energy carriers. The automotive sector especially the road (passenger) transport is 
        quickly moving away from fossil fuels. The “difficult-to-decarbonise” transport applications will have to rely 
        on liquid fuels for several decades to come, but they have to be much cleaner and greener. 
        Liquid fuels are defined in terms of property specifications instead of the composition. 
        As the substitute for fossil-based kerosene, diesel and HFO, theoretically, 
        any feedstock-technology combination can be used to produce sustainable alternative fuels, 
        provided that the fuel meets the sustainability criteria and the properties meet the technical specifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formulation of next-generation sustainable fuels can be greatly enhanced by artificial intelligence, 
        which has the potential of quickly identifying the best fuel composition. 
        DeepFuel is developed to enable intelligent fuel formulation. 
        By mapping molecules with properties of fuel blends for engines, it accelerates the design of high-performance, 
        low-carbon fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for aviation and diesel-type of alternatives 
        for road freight and shipping.
      </p>  
      DeepFuel-kit enables researchers and innovators to leverage advanced AI, 
      molecular feature extraction, and predictive modelling tools, thereby facilitating the design of 
      next-generation sustainable fuels in a more rapid, insightful, and environmentally friendly manner.
